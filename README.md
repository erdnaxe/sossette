**Sossette** listens for incoming TCP connections and establishes bidirectional
bytes streams between users and instances of a program.

Compared to the `socat + timeout` combo:

  - The target process group always gets killed when the socket is closed.
    Works well with `cpulimit` and `qemu`.
  - Optional proof-of-work system.
  - Deployment using a single statically linked binary (using musl).

This project is developed for [France Cybersecurity Challenge](https://fcsc.fr/)
since 2023.

You might also want to have a look at these alternatives:

  - [`socaz` by Cybersecurity National Lab](https://hub.docker.com/r/cybersecnatlab/socaz) (closed-source)
  - [`socat + timeout`](https://docs.ctfd.io/tutorials/challenges/network-service-challenge-containers/)

## Release build

You may directly download release builds [from GitHub releases](https://github.com/erdnaxe/sossette/releases/).

Else, you can rebuild the binary:
 1. Make sure you have `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` Rust target.
    If you are using `rustup` to manage your Rust installation,
    you may run `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`.
 2. Run `cargo build --release`.
 3. Output will be at `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/sossette`.

`sossette` binary can be copied inside a empty Docker container as it is
statically compiled. `Dockerfile` example:
```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
WORKDIR /app/
COPY ./sossette .
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["./sossette", "-l", "0.0.0.0:4000", "./my-challenge"]
```

## Debug build

For example, to run `cat` on `localhost:4000` with a timeout of 10 seconds
and a message of the day `Chaussette`:
```
$ cargo run -- -l localhost:4000 -t 10 -m "Chaussette" cat -- --show-nonprinting
[2023-01-30T12:00:19Z INFO  ctf_wrapper] Listening on localhost:4000
[2023-01-30T12:00:20Z INFO  ctf_wrapper] Client [::1]:55438 connected
[2023-01-30T12:00:27Z INFO  ctf_wrapper] Client [::1]:55438 disconnected
```

Then in another console:
```
$ nc localhost 4000
Chaussette
hello
hello
world
world
^C
```

## Applying transformations to stdin

`process_stdin` in [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs) can be easily patched to apply
some transformation to users inputs before passing then to the underlaying
program.

For example [FCSC 2023 Sous Marin challenge](https://hackropole.fr/en/challenges/hardware/fcsc2023-hardware-sous-marin/) uses the following patch:

```diff

          }
